            <p> The special day is here, a day to celebrate a graceful queen. You are every shade of an amazing woman. Words would never do justice to how precious you are to me.
                You have turned my life around in so short a time, filling my life with so much love.
                I pray this new age gifts you with everything beautiful and colourful.
                Happy birthday, queen.....</p>

                It’s so amazing having you in my life, so on this occasion, gifts will not be enough, neither will words be.
